# Frontend Notes

This directory is the React + Vite frontend for TalentScout.

## Quick Start
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build
```bash
npm run build
```
Build output lives in `dist/` and can be deployed to any static host (Netlify, Vercel, etc.).

## Environment
Set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in `.env` to point the UI at your backend (defaults to `http://localhost:8000` if provided).
